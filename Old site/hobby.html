                    <br>
Getting started as a Front End Developer, I put as a teenager. The first lines of code were well advanced but edit and create simple HTML pages not caused me any difficulty. However, learning and work did not allow me to systematically develop this knowledge. Only a few months ago once again I started their adventure in designing and creating websites. I began to develop knowledge about HTML5 - SASS, RWD, Bootstrap and CSS3 of course. The next step is to develop knowledge of JavaScript. This website is my first project, because I believe that every Front End Developer must first create a page for himself.</p>

				<h3>Certified Software Tester</h3>
                <center><img src="images/testing.jpg"/></center>      
				<p align="justify">
Software development has always been an interesting and inspiring for me. My innate curiosity and stubbornness made that I always wanted to know how the program works and whether it contains errors. As an IT specialist, repeatedly I came across a program errors and malfunctions. This caused my interest in testing and software quality. My first steps in software testing is a manual test, black-box testing. When I was a certified software tester, according to the ISTQB certification began his adventure with the tests speed manual. Despite the lack of commercial experience in this field I try to develop their knowledge also in my work.</p>
