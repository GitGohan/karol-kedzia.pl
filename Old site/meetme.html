<br>
<p align="justify">Karol Kędzia was born in 1986. He comes from Czestochowa. For 11 years he has lived in Krakow. Hi is a IT specialist in e-commerce, software developer, software tester, but also an avid guitarist.</p>
<br>
<p><font color="blue">Question:</font> From what I know you work in e-commerce?</p>
<p><font color="green">Answer:</font> Not only. It is one of many sectors in which I work, and skills that I have.</p>
<br>
<p><font color="blue">Question:</font> Is e-commerce is a skill?</p>
<p><font color="green">Answer:</font> 
Rather, the experience that I have acquired over the years of work. Because who now creates an e-commerce specialists? Colleges? Training? No. Trade on the Internet, you can learn only by hard work, committing thousands of errors.</p>
<br>
<p><font color="blue">Question:</font> Many of them were?</p>
<p><font color="green">Answer:</font> 
At the beginning certainly so, but I learn quickly. A bit of knowledge about logistics and trade, as well as a lot of common sense can work wonders.</p>
<br>
<p><font color="blue">Question:</font> What else do you do besides creating and managing online stores?</p>
<p><font color="green">Answer:</font> I am an IT specialist. E-commerce can not be called a specialized branch. It requires many skills from various branches of knowledge. IT technology, logistics, management, etc. I believe that the world belongs to specialists hence my constant willingness to develop other skills which of course also useful in my work. Interest in programming, software testing and software life cycles, it is the expertise that I have acquired during their studies, but not only. For me it is a passion that satisfies me enormously.</p>
<br>
<p><font color="blue">Question:</font> You come from Częstochowa?</p>
<p><font color="green">Answer:</font> Yes and no. I was born in Kętrzyn (Rastenburg) in the land of Polish lakes. Mazury (Masuria), but I grew up in Częstochowa. Besides, for 11 years I lived in one of the most beautiful cities in the world, namely in Krakow. It's hard for me to settle in one place.</p>
<br>
<center><img src="images/gh3.png"/></center>
<br>
<p><font color="blue">Question:</font> What place will be next?</p>
<p><font color="green">Answer:</font> Time will tell. Ultimately? Auckland. New Zealand.</p>
<br>
<p><font color="blue">Question:</font> Why New Zealand?</p>
<p><font color="green">Answer:</font> Because it's a beautiful country, where they live, great people. It is my holy grail. Everyone must have some dreams and goals he wants to achieve. Visit and even stay forever in New Zealand is that my goal. In my life I have visited most countries in Europe. I would like to see as the "end of the world" looks.</p>
<br>
<p><font color="blue">Question:</font> How do you see yourself in 10 years?</p>
<p><font color="green">Answer:</font> Exactly like today, only 10 years older. I hope I'll be just as happy as I am today. 10 years is a lot, but a little at a time. I know one thing.Certainly I do not want to slow down the pace of my life.</p>
<br>
<p><font color="blue">Question:</font> ... which is?</p>
<p><font color="green">Answer:</font> ... faster than the average person. I have so much energy that I have to keep going. It's hard to stop.</p>
<br>
<p><font color="blue">Question:</font> I have heard that you have a weakness for technological innovations?</p>
<p><font color="green">Answer:</font> It stems from my passion, education and occupation. Which, IT specialist does not have such weaknesses?</p>
<br>
<p><font color="blue">Question:</font> It is true. How do you spend your free time?</p>
<p><font color="green">Answer:</font> Unfortunately I have not it much, but I try to save much as I can. I love to play guitar, programming, travel.</p>
<br>
<center><img src="images/gh.png"/></center>
<br>
<p><font color="blue">Question:</font> Where have you been lately?</p>
<p><font color="green">Answer:</font> The last time I visited Greece and Great Britain. Beautiful countrys, lovely people. I hope to return there in the future.</p>
<br>
<p><font color="blue">Question:</font> A little bit from the other side. What inspires you??</p>
<p><font color="green">Answer:</font> Great people, and how a human being can be good. I have a lot of authority and love meeting great people. Read their resumes, explore their achievements. It inspires me, gives me energy and, in a way, I try to be like them.</p>
<br>
<p><font color="blue">Question:</font> Who is your greatest authority?</p>
<p><font color="green">Answer:</font> 
Of course I have a lot of them, but if I have to name one person it probably will be it Steve Jobs. He said once: "Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma – which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of other’s opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary". Is it not inspiring?</p>
<br>
<p><font color="blue">Question:</font> Very. It's your favorite quote?</p>
<p><font color="green">Answer:</font> No. My favorite quote is: "What does not kill us makes us stronger". Friedrich Nietzsche</p>
<br>
<p><font color="blue">Question:</font> Why this?</p>
<p><font color="green">Answer:</font> Because it helps at the time of failure. It gives motivation to act on, and defeat is an integral part of our lives. We have to make friends with it and accept it.</p>
<br>
<p><font color="blue">Question:</font> Do you have any hobbies besides those you mentioned?</p>
<p><font color="green">Answer:</font> Yes, there are very many.</p>
<br>
<p><font color="blue">Question:</font> Tell us about them.</p>
<p><font color="green">Answer:</font> Where to start? I love music. I play a little guitar, and recently became a fan of vinyl records. I saved already a small collection. Besides, I love the sport. I'm a big fan of rugby!</p>
<br>
<p><font color="blue">Question:</font> What rugby team you support?</p>
<p><font color="green">Answer:</font> What do you think?</p>
<br>
<p><font color="blue">Question:</font> ?</p>
<p><font color="green">Answer:</font> Of course the All Blacks. National Team New Zealand.</p>
<br>
<center><img src="images/gh2_1.png"/></center>
<br>
<p><font color="blue">Question:</font> What else?</p>
<p><font color="green">Answer:</font> My great passion is history. I am an avid Historical Reenactor and this passion with me for many many years.</p>
<br>
<p><font color="blue">Question:</font> Do you have something to say in conclusion?</p>
<p><font color="green">Answer:</font> I want to thank everyone who reached it to the website. It is a real honor for me.</p>

My adventure with programming began in 2015, but the first line of HTML code I written as a teenager. Immediately I knew that the Front - End quickly will be my passion. I was not mistaken. My experience in web design is not big, but I try to systematically increase my knowledge. I try to learn new technologies while knowing that only commercial experience will allow me to move fluently in technologies to create web pages. One of the results of my work is this website which prepared entirely independently.</p>

Software development cycles have always been for me an interesting and inspiring. 
Getting started as a software tester I put while studying. My innate curiosity and stubbornness made me want to know how programs work and do not contain defects and errors. Interest in this subject has resulted in increasing my knowledge and preparation for the ISTQB certification exam which I received in 2015. Despite the lack of commercial experience in this field, I try to develop my knowledge regularly. In recent intensively I am working on Selenium WebDriver test automation in using the Python scripting language.</p>
